The purpose of this program is to mimic managing a Video Store Inventory 

This program allows a user to manage the inventory of a store that sells DVDs. 

The inventory for the video store will contain the following information for each movie
(each title) in the inventory:

    SKU (stock-keeping unit, an integer, must be unique)
    title (may contain spaces in it)
    price (dollars and cents, greater than 0)
    quantity (number of copies in inventory, greater than or equal to 0)

The program should offer the user a menu with the following options:
    1. Add a movie to the inventory (prompt user for input values in this order: sku,
    title, price, quantity).
    2. Remove a movie from the inventory (by sku).
    3. Display the information for a movie (given the sku).
    4. Display the inventory in a table (in any order).
    5. Quit
    
The program should perform the operation selected by number and then re-display the
menu. If the operation fails (i.e. invalid input or attempt to remove a movie not in the
inventory) your program should display an error message and return to the menu. 

Your program should store the inventory in a file between executions of the program, so
that when the program is run again it will start up with the same inventory contents as
when it last terminated (use serialization!). Your program must run even if the file is
not present (initial inventory will be empty).
