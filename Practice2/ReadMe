The purpose of this program is to simulate mangaging an inventory for a books, toys, and video store by using inheritance

The Books, Toys, and Videos all have common attributes being: 

    - SKU (stock-keeping unit, an integer, must be unique)
    - title (may contain spaces in it)
    - price (dollars and cents, greater than 0)
    - quantity (number of copies in inventory, greater than or equal to 0)
    
 Along with these common attributes, each item needs additional attributes, depending on what the product type:
 
    - Movies (DVDs) Need:
         * a UPC (universal product code)
    - Books Need:
         * an ISBN (international standard book number)
         * author name 
    - Toys 
         * weight (in ounces)

The program should offer the user a menu with the following options:

    1. Add a product to the inventory (user should enter a letter (M or B or T) to
    indicate the product category and then input corresponding values).
    2. Remove a product from the inventory (by sku).
    3. Display the information for a product (given the sku).
    4. Display the inventory in a table, sorted by sku.
    5. Display the inventory in a table, sorted by title.
    6. Process a sale.
    7. Quit
    
    
 When processing a sale, each product has different shipping credits and commission percentage: 
    Product Type      Shipping credit     Commission
    Movie             $2.98               12% of price
    Book              $3.99               15% of price 
    Toys              $4.49 + $0.50 /lb   15% of price
    
 Once user processes sale the following is outputted: 
 
    Total price (the product’s price times the quantity sold)
    Total shipping credit (the product’s shipping credit times the quantity sold)
    Total commission (the product’s commission times the quantity sold)
    Profit = Total price + Total shipping credit - (Total commission + shipping cost)
